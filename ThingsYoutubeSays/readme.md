This is the ThingsYoutube Says bot that takes a YouTube video posted on Reddit, and posts the best Youtube comments in the comments section on reddit.

Run __main__.py in order to activate the bot. It cannot run too often as Reddit limits the amount of posts allowed. In order to automate it, I suggest using Task Scheduler for Windows. A method to automate on Linux will be added soon.
